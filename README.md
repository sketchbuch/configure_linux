# Configure Linux

My ansible setup to configure linux and install apps etc. in real and virtual environments.

## Supported Distros and versions

- Ubuntu 24.04
- Fedora 40

## Prerequisites

- **Install Git**

  - `sudo apt install git` (Ubuntu)

- **Install Ansible**

  - `sudo apt install ansible` (Ubuntu)
  - `sudo dnf install ansible` (Fedora)

- **Install Flatpak**

  - See official guide, e.g. <https://flatpak.org/setup/Ubuntu>
  - Although flatpak can be installed via ansible, a restart is required.
  - Ubuntu:

    - `sudo apt install flatpak`
    - `sudo apt install gnome-software-plugin-flatpak`
    - `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`
    - `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

  - Fedora:

    - Already setup on Fedora, but you can set remotes if needed:
    - `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`
    - `flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`

- **Install psutil**

  - `sudo apt-get install -y python3-psutil` (Ubuntu)

## Run

`sudo ansible-pull -U https://github.com/sketchbuch/configure_linux.git local.yaml`
